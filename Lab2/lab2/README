1.How will the first recursive call to towers() be invoked? Answer this question in the form: 
towers(x, y, z) where you give the actual values to the three parameters.  

The first recursive call to towers() that will be invoked is towers(0,2,1)
0 = number of disks
2 = from point
1 = to destination

2.How many recursive calls to towers() will be made before this first recursive call actually returns to the initial invocation?  

5 recursive calls to to towers() will be made before this first recursive call actually returns to the initial invocation.

3.Once towers(5, 2, 3) has invoked its first recursive call to towers() and this invocation has returned, what will be printed to stdout? 

The invocation is returned at Move #5 where the disc is moved from tower 2 to tower 3

4.How will the second recursive call to towers() be invoked?

The Second recursive call is towers(0, 3, 2)
0 = number of disks
3 = from point
2 = to destination

Question:Suppose that towers(8, 1, 2) is invoked. How many lines will be printed to stdout?  
255 lines will be printed
